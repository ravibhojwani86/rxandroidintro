rxandroidintro demoes how to start Rxifying the AsyncTasks in your android project. This was the first thing 
I wanted to know before starting with RxJava but could not find  that many clear examples. The code here provides samples for all
types of Observables and those that can be used to replace your asynctasks doing background operation to either make a network call 
or a DB query to fetch some object.
